# Food4Needy : Hack-N-Cody
It aims to reduce wastage of food upto 75% by connecting 2 types of end users(broad category).
1. Donor (who dontes food)
2. Needy (who needs food)

we divided food in 3 categories
1. Raw
2. Fresh
3. Waste

As soon as Donor submits the form data, all the users who have created account in Needy category will get notification on their mail and profile as well.
We implemented this feature using Django Signals (pre-save).
As soon as any of the user accepts the Food it will be hidden from all other users and if the Needy takes partial food as per requirement it will show the remaining food to other users.
